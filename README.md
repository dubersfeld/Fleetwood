A Java based demo REST client designed to work with the demo REST server Sharewood for photo sharing.

I present here a Spring based REST consumer that is designed to work with the REST photo sharing server Sharewood using an OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant supported by Spring OAuth2.

The configuration is done using Spring annotations and all URI are externally configured using a .properties file.

The demo server Sharewood can be found in the repository:
